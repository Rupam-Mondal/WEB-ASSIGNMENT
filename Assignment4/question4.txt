list how we can make accessable our web site:-

1.we can 'alt' attributes in img tag so that if it fails to render it will give the user information about that picture.

2.we can use 'tabindex' attribute in form so that user can directly go to his/her prefered option by clicking tab.

3.we should use proper semantic tag like <header> , <footer> to give proper structure of our web site that will be helpful for screen readers
