    <h1>About web design</h1>
    <P>
        Web design is the planning and creation of websites. This includes a number of separate skills that all fall under the
        umbrella of web design. Some examples of these skills are information architecture, user interface, site structure,
        navigation, layout, colors, fonts, and overall imagery.
