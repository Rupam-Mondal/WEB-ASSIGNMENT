// We should always give meaning full variable name in the code. It increases readability
// of the code. Suppose i have to store age in a variable but i gave variable to name "firstname"
// then obiously it will create problem in reading the code.

// *It will not create any issue in user side but to make understand other developer we should
// follow the rules 

let age = 18
console.log(age);
