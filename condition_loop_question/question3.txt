loops are very important in programming it helps us to any repeatative work
without loop we have write that particular code multiple times so it is very important in 
programming

there are multiple loops present but in class sir has told about only three loops
1.for loop  
        ex :- for(let i = 0 ; i < n ; i++)
              {
                    console.log("Hello sir");
              }
2. while loop   
        ex :-
            while(condition)
            {
                body
            }

3.do-while loop 
        ex:-
            do{
                body
            }
            while(condition);
